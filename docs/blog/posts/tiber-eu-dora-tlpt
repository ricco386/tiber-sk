The TIBER-EU framework can also assist competent authorities and financial entities in meeting the requirements for threat-led penetration tests under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). See [this publication](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/intro/publications/pdf/ecb.miptopical240926.en.pdf) for further information on how adopting the TIBER-EU framework can help fulfil these DORA requirements.

# TIBER

Increase your Cyber Resilience with TIBER

The threat intelligence led red teaming framework implemented in over 16 countries

## What is the TIBER framework?

The TIBER framework provides a structured process to perform controlled cyber attacks on the live systems of vital infrastructure based on threat intelligence. The goal is to increase the cyber resilience of organisations and their sector as a whole.

## Why should you implement TIBER-EU?

Implementing TIBER-EU as an authority or supervisor has numerous advantages for your sector. The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) should not be the only reason to adopt this framework to perform Threat Led Penetration Testing (TLPT).
